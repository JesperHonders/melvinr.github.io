#Opdracht 2 
##Voor- en nadelen JavaScript libraries/frameworks onderzoeken

##Voordelen
- Easy and fast.
- A lot of documentation. Most frameworks have a fairly big community, which means there's a lot of possible help and usually a lot of information online.

##Nadelen
- When you learn a framework you don't (necessarily) learn the language. jQuery is a good example, knowing jQuery does not mean you know how to write javascript.
- It can limit the things you can do. A framework has a core (the way it's functionality is coded) and this can't be modified. So you're forced to work within its limits.
